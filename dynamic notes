Sequenced list of stories for Orbygraph

- make a set of presets (may involve refactoring to make more MVC)
- create animations from change loop.  In other words render each change-loop
image into a frame and save it with a sequential filename and then combine them
into an animation.  Any resolution, any aspect ratio. 
- frames per second
- length of animation in hours minutes seconds
- Another change loop level like a meta change loop
- look into making animations by stitching together images on a unix environment
on the server and not manually.  Be able to generate animations of any size and
download them, possibly playing them in a video tag.
- make youtube channel for animations
- stitching together animation with an audio file.
- somehow charge people whatever the Joyent is charging me except double or
triple it.
- Give the user a certain amount of free animation use, let them use it up to
let them know how much they can do for how much it costs.  Have an itemized list
of jobs they did and how much it cost and why.  Then they have to purchase
credits ahead of time using paypal just to start off.  Later if and when it
makes sense start using your own handling of credit card numbers.
- The whole thing needs to be automatic.  I make money essentially reselling
processing, bandwidth, and storage.  I should be able to work on it if I want to
and not if I don't.

- saving settings between sessions - yes but only when the features and the
model program is locked down, and if I add or delete features it should only add
to the model and never subtract from it.  Saving image settings can be a pay
only feature.
- authentication should only use secret code authentication so people can use it
without providing any personal information.  Also because people can't be
trusted to generate good passwords.

- When the site makes what I make at Terumo for a solid year then quit and work
on SaVaGe just like flash except without the security holes, the browser
plug-ins that require constant updates and it's all web based.  There will be an
editor and player.  The player is free and is a Javascript file that is loaded
in with a page.  Then the content creators use the editor to create content.
Still images are free, animation costs a small amount.  It will cost money to
create animations, whatever Joyent charges x 2 which will be a very small
amount.

- expand SaVaGe to work with collections of photographs helps to make a special
kind of stop-motion animation to make a TV shows and movies.

If a customer makes a movie the individual images are uploaded to the server,
the transfers have a cost in bandwidth, and saved until the custommer deletes
them.  The storage has a cost.  A lossless movie stitched together from
thousands of individual images has a processing cost.  The default is that the
movie is made but perhaps the user can stitch it together themselves so all they
do is download the images and delete them from the server.
The movie in it's lossless state will be huge, that has a cost of storage.
The movie is then transcoded into one or more lossless or lossy versions.
That storage costs.
If the customer then downloads the individual images, the original lossless
movie, and the transcoded version, that transfer costs.

Make movie button.
checkbox for make movie after generation of images.
checkbox for download individual images after generation and then delete from
server. checkbox for delete images from server after download.

Free portion
- make still images lossless unlimited.


- move site to jvonachen account instead of root
- purchase or aquire an authoritatively signed certificate
- change node.js server to be https
- add/design the secret code authentication system
	- The user can push a button and it will tell the server to generate a secret
	code from random.org.
	- before or after they do this they can check a box saying store the secret
	code in a cookie on this browser.  The default is to not store.  The user may
	be using a public computer or a computer that other people have common access
	to.  If the cookie does not exist then if/when the box is checked it will make
	the cookie.  If the cookie exists then if/when the box is unchecked it will
	delete the cookie.
	- The secret code is normally displayed as asterisks in an input.  You can
	push a button and it will temporarily display the secret code for 30 or 60
	seconds and then timeout and turn back into asterisks.  If the button is
	pressed again before the timeout it will turn back into asterisks immediately.
	- The user can write down the secret code while it is being displayed and use
	it in a different browser and/or a different computer in order to have access
	to their account.
	- The secret code authentication system has a couple of advantages. 1. It
	eliminates a major problem with security, the fact that most people use the
	same password over and over again. People can't be trusted to choose good
	passwords.  2. Since the secret code is random and unique it serves as both a
	username and a password.  People also often use the same username for
	everything.  In this way the user need not identify themselves with their
	username and also need not provide any other information about themselves.
	This is sometimes a barrier to signing up for an account.  They can use a
	service in a minimal way and do so completely anonymously.
- Figure out how Joyent charges me for bandwidth, storage, cpu use.
- Deveop the animation part
- install an instance of mongo on my joyent account
- be able to store/retrieve image/animation data to mongo
- figure out how much it costs me to have a customer use the server for each
little thing
- Give the user $10 credit for creating an account.
- Give the user a report on the current credit and how much a given operation
will cost each time they do something that costs money, even if it's a fraction
of a penny.
- If they don't have enough credit they can buy more credit or they can not do
the operation.
- Allow the users to only buy chunks of credit $10, $100, $1,000, $10,000
through Paypal.
- Make animations for phone or tablet users and charge a dollar for each
download.  Also use that to market the service.

- SEO

- At the end of the cm checkbox add a button for final animation.  It should
have a price on it.
- Add an extra row for draft animation. frame begin, frame end, scalar for
reducing the size, and a button for generating a draft animation with a price
on it.

Hello Orbygraphers or potential Orbygraphers.  My name is John Vonachen and I wrote this web software called Orbygraph.  It's what I call an "art-toy".  By playing with the toy you create art.  Years ago, not that long ago really, a Spirograph caught my eye and I made a number of drawings with it.  At the time I was learning how to use the cavas tag in HTML5.  This inspired me to make a peice of web software, similar but instead I used only circular orbits with cycles and epicycles, not really the hypotrochoids and epitrochoids which are what Spirograph makes.  To me they look like orbits and I think that's probably why it was popular in 1965 when the world was space happy.  What I made was interesting with the circular orbits, especially when you animate it, but I could do better than that.  I wanted to make it with real (simulated) gravity.  But even more, provide a tool for other people to create art using the SVG (Scaleable Vector Graphic) tag in HTML5.

<Button for generating a still image>

- Full version of moving image
	- Inputs
		- hours
		- minutes
		- seconds
		- or upload sound file and HMS is derived from that
		- FPS, floating point?
	- Outputs
		- total seconds
		- total frames
		- memory size in MB
		- cost
			- time (how long will it take to generate the movie)
			- money (how much will it cost me)
<Button for generating the full quality version of the movie> - Should bring up a confirmation alert telling the user
how long it will take (estimate) and how much it will cost.  Are you sure you want this to start?  Yes, No.  After
starting, the user should be shown in real time how much time it has taken so far, how much time it will still take
(estimate), how much it has cost so far, how much it will cost when finished.  The user should be able to pause or stop
(with confirmation) the current render anytime, but they are still charged for incomplete renders, make sure the user
is aware of this.  Users are given $10 credit free with an account.  $10 should be enough for a months worth of
rendering either the full or draft.  After that they would need to provide an email address associated with paypal.
Users can purchase blocks of credit: $10, $100, $1000, etc.  Buttons that cost money will be disabled when the user does
not have enough credit.  This circumstance should be checked on the server at the time of the AJAX call also.  If the
user has circumvented the client side button, disabled state, and does not have enough credit then it should give an
alert saying they do not have enough credit.  That user's account should note the fact that they tried to cheat it.
All of this applies to the draft button also.

- Draft version of moving image
	- inputs
		- dimensions 1/[a] (1/2, 1/3, 1/4, etc.)
		- Time 1/[b]
			- 1/2 - generate every frame locally but only saves every other frame.  For instance if the FPS of the full
			version is 24 this would be 12fps
			- 1/3 - generate every frame locally but only saves every third frame.  This would be 8fps.
			- 1/4 6fps
			- etc.  how do you handle FPS that is floating point?
		- Range (not for this version but for when we are making more than just abstract images)
			- beginning H:MM:SS
			- ending H:MM:SS
	- outputs
		- total seconds remains the same
		- total frames is reduced
		- FPS derived from ratio, then that calculated FPS is applied to the generation of the MP4 on the server.
		Might become floating point.
		- memory size should be reduced, expressed in MB
		- cost
			- time reduced
			- money reduced

- Play the audio and hit keys, or keys on a midi keyboard, those messages change the animation.
- Midi keyboards not only have many keys but also can sense velocity and polyphonic after-touch which could be very
useful for communicating information to an animation.
- You can play the sound back at any speed, preferably at a slower speed, and layers of changes to the animation can be
applied in multiple sessions.
- Preferably the audio is played back slower but not lower.  In other words the audio is time stretched for the sake of
timing and sync.
- Later you can adjust the animation event markers manually to perfect the coordination.

Have a checkbox called create animation and what happens is that when you press an adjusting button that effects the
image it will continue applying that step's adjustment until you press it again or you uncheck the create animation
checkbox.  Each one is a toggle and will change color or something showing that it is engaged.  You can change the step
also in the middle of it.  You can have as many going as you like.  You listen to a song being played from anywhere,
make this animation and then stitch the two together using some other software.

What if the images become too complex to generate in a given frame rate?  Stop or limit the image after a time threshold
is exceeded.

Actually playback speed of an HTML5 audio tag can be played back at any speed so figure out how fast the current set of
images can be made and slow down the playback so the "artist" has time to make animation changes in time with the music.
Also when thse record button is toggled on it means that audio playback will start as soon as the user adds a particle.

Should be able to make animations without any audio.

The simplest thing to do is provide a button, "now", to save this image at the chosen resolution.  That way you can make
multiple changes and press save. *That was pretty stupid*

The next simplest thing to do would be to check a checkbox, called "each", where each adjustment saves an image.  You
would only be able to adjust one thing at a time for each frame but sometimes that's all you want to do.  Then uncheck
the checkbox and it won't save.  When that box is checked it should disable the save now button and un-checking should
re-enable it. *easier and useful but still pretty tedious*

The next more complicated thing to do would be to check another box called "flow" where clicking an adjustment will
continue to adjust and the image changes every x FPS, or it will try to anyway.  Perhaps 24FPS will be an upper limit.
It will continue to adjust until a limit is hit or the button is hit again or the opposite direction is hit.  This means
the step values will need to be very small.

Should be able to specify transparent for the background color. Also should be able to have a shaped mask where the
generated image elements are masked out in a way other than just the square or rectangle of the full image shape.  That
way you can make animations for VJ software.

**********************************************

Instead of "downloading" the images, in other words saving them locally, I should upload them to the server and when
finished the server should stitch them into animations and then download the completed movie file.
